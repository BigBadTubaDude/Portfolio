			<h2>Gary L. Burgess SC State Superintendent of Education Campaign Site</h2>
			<p>This was developed by Joel Vasquez and myself as the official campaing site for Gary L. Burgess. I also managed the hosting of the site on GoDaddy for the campaign. Burgess came in second in the SC Democratic primaries on June 14, 2022 with 54,464 votes (<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Gary_Burgess">BallotPedia</a>). The official site will be up for a few months, but after it is down, the site will still be visible on GitHub Pages.</p>
